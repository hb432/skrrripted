# Skrrripted
Set the initial position of the ball and cars on the field, then apply frame-perfect inputs to each car.

# Usage (For Dummies)
Download and extract the contents of this repository. Then, navigate to the extracted files and double-click the `run-gui.bat` file. Once the RLBot GUI opens, click "Run" in the lower-right corner. Rocket League will open, and after a few seconds, a local lobby will be created. It is in this lobby that the bots will do their thing.

At the moment, kickoffs are inconsistent. After the kickoff countdown ends, be sure to pause and un-pause the game at least once. Once you've done that, well, sit back and enjoy the show.

**Note: You will need to set your game's max FPS to 60.** It's at the bottom left of Rocket League's "video" settings tab.

# Config
You can set the target script in the `src/agent.json` file.

# Scripts
Creating new scripts is simple. Examples have been provided for you in the `src/scripts` folder, which you can use as starting points for your own scripts.

**Note:** An in-depth wiki will be created for this soon.

# Tips
While editing, you can reload the current script by pausing and un-pausing the game.
