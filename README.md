# Usage (For Dummies)

To install skrrripted, clone or download this repository and copy the root folder to `%AppData%\Local\RLBotGUI\MyBots`. *Eventually, this bot will be directly available via the bot pack, but for now this is the recommneded method.*

**Note: You will need to set your game's FPS to 60 for consistent results.** It's at the bottom left of Rocket League's "video" settings tab. Frame drops will also cause inconsistencies, so make sure that your game runs at a consistent 60 FPS.

# Known Issues

Sometimes, scripts starts from the kickoffs can be inconsistent. Make sure to pause and unpause your game at least once after a kickoff to avoid this.

The skrrripted interface may not always open due to leftover temporary files. To fix this, press "Start Match" again in the RLBot GUI. You may have to do this twice on rare occasions.
