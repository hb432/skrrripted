# Skrrripted
Set the initial position of the ball and cars on the field, then apply frame-perfect inputs to each car.

# Usage (For Dummies)
Make sure you have Rocket League installed and NOT currently open. Download this repository via a ZIP file and extract the contents. Then, navigate to the extracted files and double-click the `run-gui.bat` file. Once the RLBot GUI opens, click "Run" in the lower-right corner. Rocket League will open into a new lobby, and once the game starts, you should see a freestyle shot being scored!

**Note: You will need to set your game's max FPS to 60.** It's at the bottom left of Rocket League's "video" settings tab.

# Config
You can set the target script in the `src/agent.json` file.

# Scripts
Creating new scripts is simple. Examples have been provided for you in the `src/scripts/` folder, which you can use as starting points for your own scripts.

**Note:** An in-depth wiki will be created for this soon.

# Tips
While editing, you can reload the current script by pausing and un-pausing the game.
