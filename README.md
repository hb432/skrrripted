# Skrrripted
Set the initial position of the ball and cars on the field, then apply frame-perfect inputs to each car.

# Usage (For Dummies)
Make sure you have Rocket League installed and NOT currently open. Download this repository via a ZIP file and extract the contents. Then, navigate to the extracted files and double-click the "run-gui.bat" file. Let the app run its course, and you will end up seeing the bot score a freestyle shot!

# Config
To create your own shots and plays, you will need to edit the `src/agent.json` file. This file contains the instruction set used to guide the ball and any cars on the field. Using the GUI, you can add more bots, but these bots will need instruction sets, or they will simply do nothing. You can use the example provided in this repository as a guide.
